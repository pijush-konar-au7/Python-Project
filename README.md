# Python-Project
Junk File Organizer

Aim

The aim of this project is to build a python program that runs as a command-line tool. Basically, as a lazy programmer, my desktop is full of files as shown below. Due to a large number of files, it is a daunting task to sit and organize each file. To make that task easy, we need a Python script that comes in handy and returns a folder where all the files are organized in a well-manner within seconds. It should organize by size, last used or even extensions.

Approach

By using the os module of python to recursively list out all the files that are present in the folders with their relative and absolute path then create a new folder with the parent called organized which will contain all the files in organized sub-folders
